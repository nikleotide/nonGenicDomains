# To calculate the RPKM in large domains in the 4 cell lines, first we need to know the number of mapped reads per sample.
# go to the directory where you store rnaseq bam files with their index files and then:
for file in *.bam;do echo $file;samtools flagstat $file | grep mapped | grep -e '(' | grep -e 'N/A' | awk '{print $1}';done
